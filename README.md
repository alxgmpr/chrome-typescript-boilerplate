# Chrome Typescript Extension Boilerplate

Cloneable boilerplate for Chrome extensions written in Typescript. Meant to serve as a starting point for new extensions.
Also meant as a personal challenge to push myself to try some new tools :).

### Demo

The demo app is a simple hello world that has a popup driven by Preact, a background service worker, and a content script
for injection.

### Getting Started

```shell
pnpm install
```

```shell
pnpm run build
```

### Fancy Features

- esbuild for fast compilation and bundling
- Preact for tiny + fast UX with React tendencies
- Chrome manifest v3 to stick with the times
